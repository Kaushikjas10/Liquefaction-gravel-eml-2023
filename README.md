# Liquefaction-gravel-eml-2023
This repository is for explainable/interpretable model to assess gravelly soil liquefaction potential. The DPT-Vs database is used to develop the model. This model is developed by using LightGBM and SHAP.

This repository contains these files: processed dataset, a csv file containing IPs of test sites, and a python script. 
This repository is part of the below project.

# File descriptions (Beta version)

(1) [Processed dataset]: It is available with the article in the supplemental material at "Appendix A".

(2) [TestSitesGravel.csv]: This is the  spreadsheet template of the test sites where you want to assess the liquefaction potential of gravelly soils using the developed model.

(3) [Model_Train_Test_KJ_SM_GRD.ipynb]: This Python script is provided to give a demonstration for using this model in the jupyter notebook platform. 

Note: This work is under process. The final article will be available after the completion of the publication peer review process.
