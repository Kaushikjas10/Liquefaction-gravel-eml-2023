# Liquefaction-gravel-eml-2023
This repository is for explainable/interpretable model to assess gravelly soil liquefaction potential. The DPT-Vs database used to developed the model. This model is developed by using LightGBM and SHAP.

This repository contains these files: processed dataset, Model B, SHAP explainer, and a csv file containing IPs of test sites. 
This repository is part of the below project.

# File descriptions (Beta version)

(1) [Processed dataset]: It is available with the article in the supplymentary material at "Appendix A".

(2) [MODEL_KJGRD.txt]: This file can be loaded in the Python platform to predict the liquefaction potential assessment for site(s) of interest having all IPs in a excel/csv spreadsheet.

(3) [TestSites.csv]: This is the  spreadsheet templates of the test sites where you want to assess liquefaction potential of gravelly soils using the developed model.
