# Liquefaction-gravel-eml-2023
This repository is for explainable/interpretable model to assess gravelly soil liquefaction potential. The DPT-Vs database is used to develop the model. This model is developed by using LightGBM and SHAP.

This repository contains these files: processed dataset, a csv file containing IPs of test sites, and a python script. 

This repository is part of the below project. If you use this in your work, dont forget to cite as below:
